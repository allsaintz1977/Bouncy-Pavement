Have you ever considered how hard, bland and boring the average pavement is? Wouldn't it be much more exciting to have pavments made out of the same material as bouncy castles?

Let's discuss, please add your comments, and like the pavements: keep it clean!

oh, and dont forget slides for downhill!

and maybe stairlifts for uphill?


Can we please have a sensible discussion about safety. Clearly uncontrolled bouncing and 'ad hoc' sliding has some patential, dare I say fatal, consequences...Yours A. Killjoy.
